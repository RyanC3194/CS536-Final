If you're already using npm and a module bundler such as webpack or Rollup, you can run the following command to install the latest SDK (Learn more):

npm install firebase

Then, initialize Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products you'd like to use.

```

// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCJbQI1dzWj8wgL1qTdCggq7ZDqYc0mmts",
  authDomain: "fir-rtc-792d0.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "fir-rtc-792d0",
  storageBucket: "fir-rtc-792d0.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "86330011416",
  appId: "1:86330011416:web:464107f0a57d0d0450b86d",
  measurementId: "G-8KCEQT5SLH"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

```
